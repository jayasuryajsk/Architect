SummarizerAgent Example - Demonstrates using the SummarizerAgent to summarize multiple results

This example shows how to use the SummarizerAgent directly to summarize results from multiple sources.

Usage:
    python examples/summarizer_example.py

Requirements:
    - Set GEMINI_API_KEY in .env or as environment variable
