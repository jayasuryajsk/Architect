Recursive Architect Example - Demonstrates the Architect's recursive planning capabilities

This example shows how the ArchitectAgent breaks down complex goals into subtasks,
assigns specialized agents to each subtask, and then synthesizes the results.

Usage:
    python examples/recursive_architect.py

Requirements:
    - Set GEMINI_API_KEY in .env or as environment variable
