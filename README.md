## 🚀 What Is Architect?

**Architect** is a self-organizing AI system that:
- Accepts high-level goals (e.g., "Compare Manus vs OWL agents")
- Plans tasks
- Spawns intelligent subagents (`Researcher`, `Critic`, etc.)
- Reads real webpages using `browser-use`
- Summarizes and stores results in persistent memory
- Loops and evolves with each cycle

It’s like AutoGPT — but real. And it works. Locally.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔁 Recursive, autonomous agent architecture
- 🌐 Real web browsing via `browser-use`
- 🧠 LLM reasoning with Ollama or OpenAI
- 🗂 Shared memory logs (JSON)
- 🛠 Modular agents (`ArchitectAgent`, `ResearcherAgent`, more coming)
- 🧰 Simple to extend and control

---

## 📦 Installation

Install system requirements:

```bash
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium

Make sure ollama is running if using a local LLM.

⸻

🧪 Run The Architect

PYTHONPATH=. python run_architect.py --goal "Research how to make a Chrome extension"

This will:
	•	Launch ArchitectAgent
	•	Plan the task
	•	Spawn a ResearcherAgent
	•	Use browser-use to search + summarize the web
	•	Write logs to browser_use/architect/memory/memory.json

⸻

🧠 Agents Included

Agent	Description
ArchitectAgent	Main planner, breaks goals into tasks, spawns agents
ResearcherAgent	Searches web, extracts info, summarizes
(soon) CriticAgent	Reviews outputs, flags low-confidence or gaps
(soon) BuilderAgent	Uses LLM + browser to generate or edit code/scripts

🛣 Roadmap
	•	Add reflection + planning loop
	•	CriticAgent to verify research quality
	•	BuilderAgent for creative/code tasks
	•	Live terminal + web UI for watching thoughts in real time
	•	SQLite/VectorDB long-term memory
	•	Deployable task engine for long-lived goal execution

🤝 Contribute

This is a bleeding-edge fork meant to explore what’s possible with local agents + browser control.
Contributions, issues, ideas, memes — all welcome.

🧠 Philosophy

Don’t prompt a chatbot.
Give an agent a goal — and let it build the solution.
